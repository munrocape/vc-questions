This webapp iterates through a shuffled list of common VC interview questions.

Use the buttons (or the return and space key) to control the questions and timer.

The [initial](https://github.com/munrocape/yc-questions/commit/2e1dfdd94bd846b621a827292e30ba16872ab6dc#diff-35315b7e9f09ce86d30cbd3f105fbbb4) question list was sourced from [this](http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/27/be-concise-the-top-questions-asked-at-a-y-combinator-interview/) Tech Crunch article by Mike Butcher. 

[Additions are welcome](https://github.com/munrocape/yc-questions/blob/master/js/questions.js)!
